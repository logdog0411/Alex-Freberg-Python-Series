# Alex-Freberg-Python-Series
I am following Alex the Analyst's Beginning Python series on Youtube. 
I am an absolute Python beginner. My only expereince was some DataCamp classes about 2 years ago when I first decided to retire from the Marine Corps. Since then I have done some coursework in R, but have really not studied coding languages very much. 
On 25 October, Alex started with a short video on variables. I followed along without changing much. Usually when I follow a tutorial video, I like to create some variations from what the host dictates. I will experiment more in the future.
